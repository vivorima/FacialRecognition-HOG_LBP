# Facial recognition based on HOG and LBP descriptors

# Steps :

## Part 1:
- Study the LBP descriptor and implement its computation for the pixels of a given image region.
- Acquisition of the frontal image of a user by the laptop camera.
- Decompose the image into regions of dimensions (16x16) and calculate the LBP histograms for each of these regions. 

## Part 2:
- Study the HOG descriptor and implement its computation for the pixels of a given image region.
- Acquisition of the front image of a user by the laptop camera.
- Decompose the image into regions of dimensions (16x16) and calculate the HOG histograms for each of these regions.
